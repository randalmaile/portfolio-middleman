# Randal Maile's Personal Portfolio

Giving the web community a taste of what I have worked on both within an organizational setting as well as independent client work and ongoing professional development.  I love to learn new technologies and have focused on front-end development as well as ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails web programming.

The site features custom responsive design elements, modern css-preprocessing, jQuery user interfaces, built using the Middleman (Ruby) static website crafting framework and intended for Heroku deployment.
